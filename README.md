A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one <a href='http://codepen.io/terryoshea/pen/pEoZJA'>here</a>.

This was built with React for Free Code Camp's 'Build a Camper Leaderboard' Project (for Data Visualization Certificate). 

The CodePen version has Babel and SCSS; these files have been converted to pure JavaScript and CSS.
